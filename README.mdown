# Scrawler - A simple Scala web crawler

## Background

Scala Crawler (scrawler) is a simple web crawler built in (duh) Scala. This is a simple project created from the perspective of a Java developer. As I grasp the language further, it is my hope to continuously refine the application to use more sophisticated features of the Scala language. 

The goal of this application is to learn the Scala language through progressive enhancement and incremental refactoring.
